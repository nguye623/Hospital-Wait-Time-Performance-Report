# Hospital-Wait-Time-Performance-Report

## üìä TL;DR ‚Äì Project Summary

**Goal**: Identify ED wait time inefficiencies across hospitals using Medicare's Timely and Effective Care data.  
**Tools**: SQL (data cleaning & aggregation), Power BI (interactive dashboard).  
**Outcome**: Created a dynamic report highlighting patient bottlenecks, regional trends, and hospital performance rankings to improve staffing, throughput, and patient satisfaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- SQL: Data cleaning, aggregation, and filtering of CMS hospital metrics
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards, conditional formatting, map & scatter visuals
- Business Insight: Translating raw data into operational improvement strategies
- Healthcare Domain Knowledge

## Project Background 

###  Project Request: Hospital Wait Time Performance Report
### Requesting Team: Operations & Quality Improvement Team
### Point of Contact: Senior Healthcare Analyst

**Project Scenario:**

The hospital‚Äôs Operations & Quality Improvement Team has noticed an increase in patient complaints regarding long emergency department (ED) wait times. Delays in initial assessment and treatment are negatively impacting patient satisfaction scores and hospital throughput. The executive team needs an ad hoc report that provides a data-driven view of hospital wait time performance and identifies key areas for improvement.

**Project Objectives:**

* Operational Efficiencies: Identify bottlenecks to help allocate staff and resources
* Compliance Benchmarking: Ensure Medicare reimbursements are maintained with positive hospital ratings. ( No Penalties)
* Increase Patient Satisfaction

**Expected Impact:**

* The report will provide data-backed insights for hospital leadership to improve patient flow and staff allocation.
* Identifying hospitals with the best practices in reducing wait times could lead to process improvements across other facilities.
* The hospital can use this data to justify requests for additional funding or staffing adjustments.

## Business Insights

**General Hospital Comparison Analysis:**
* Several hospitals show consistently poor rankings across multiple metrics. Suggesting systemic inefficiencies through the hospital as a whole. Top Performers should serve as a benchmark for best practices.
* OP-22 highlights clear patient disengagement in poorly performing hospitals.

**Emergency Department Bottleneck Analysis:**
* A positive correlation exists between ED wait times and higher walkout rates.
* Some hospitals have long front-end delays (OP_18b). Suggesting triage or resource bottlenecks.
* And in some hospitals, ED-2 is greater than OP_18b. Suggesting a post-admission bottleneck, such as bed shortages.

**Regional Trends:**
* High-volume states like New York, California, and Texas show elevated average wait times. Suggest a potential resource strain.
* Some states also exhibit moderate volume while experiencing long delays, indicating poor efficiency.

**Seasonal/Time-based Trends:**
* A time-based trend analysis was considered, but due to inconsistent reporting in 2023-Q4 and insufficient historical data, only 2024-Q1 was analyzed for comparative insights.

### Overall Business Conclusions.
* Hospital-level ranking reveals performance gaps, helping stakeholders target underperformers.
* Wait time vs Walkout analysis proves a direct correlation between long days and patient retention.
* Geographic patterns show that volume is a major strain factor. But does not exclude potential inefficiencies in lower volume states.
